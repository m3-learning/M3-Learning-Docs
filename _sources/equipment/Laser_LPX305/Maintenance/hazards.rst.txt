Hazards
=======

Radiation exposure
------------------

**Warning**: LPX305 is a Class IV laser that can produce a ~20 ns pulse of up to 1000 mJ at 248 nm and a repetition rate of 1 to 100 Hz during normal operation. Approved laser glasses are required during laser operation and any time the user is in Bossone 530 and the laser light is on. Direct exposure of the skin and eye tissue to any Class IV laser can result in severe damage. Specular and diffuse reflections are also harmful to the eye tissue. Thus, approved laser glasses must be worn at all times behind the laser curtain.

High Voltage
------------

**Warning**: The laser operates at high voltage (24 kV). Electrical shock or electrocution could result from contact with the high voltage power supply. During normal operation it should not be able to access the high voltage lines.

Toxic and compressed gases
--------------------------

**Warning**: The gas mixture used as the lasing medium contains a mixture of Fluorine (<0.1%), Krypton, Helium, and Neon. In concentrated form, exposure to Fluorine gas can be deadly. A gas leak will be accompanied by a sharp, sulfurous-like smell (i.e., like rotten eggs). Additionally, the gas mixture is in compressed form and can be a potential explosion hazard if proper safety procedure is not followed. Finally, the lasing cavity is kept over atmospheric pressure at a pressure of 3300 mbar.
